# The-Crows
A blend between card games and narrative-based text games. Play as a British gang in 1920's London wrestling for control over the streets.

<h2>Gameply</h2>
Read the current story in the top area of the screen, then select one of the cards in your hand to react to the story. Cards marked in red have a random chance of success or failure. 

Depending on the action that you choose, your gang will either lose or gain control over London. You can also either draw extra cards to provide more options to you or gain new cards in your deck. All depends on the choices that you make.

You win the game by going through all of the events in the game without going down to 0 control.
